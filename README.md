Implementation of a stock price predictor algorithm in python with Long Short-Term Neural Network model

Stock trading refers to the act of buying and selling stocks in a free-market stock exchange. Unlike investing, which is a long-term strategy used to maximize return on investment, trading is a short-term strategy used to produce faster profits. Trading is extremely risky, difficult, and competitive, and while it can generate considerable returns it can also bring about sizeable losses.

This proposal describes the implementation of a machine learning (ML) algorithm to assist a trading company in making automatic, human-free, trading decisions with the purpose of increasing profitability.

Algorithmic trading refers to the execution of trading algorithms to place real-time trades in financial markets. Machine learning algorithms are used to build predictive models that distinguish patterns in large amounts of data.

The machine learning solution to be developed is an algorithm that will make use of the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network model to identify patterns and relations in stocksâ€™ daily movements, to predict their price direction, and automatically place trades accordingly, without human intervention.
